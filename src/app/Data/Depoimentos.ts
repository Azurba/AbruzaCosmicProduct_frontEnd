/*
- I have an angular app when one of the sections will display clients rating about the product. I will display 12 rating at a time. I want that every 10 seconds, 12 new ratings substitute the currents one, without using a carousel. All the ratings are inside of an array and I am using a *ngFor to dynamically display all of them. What are your suggestion on how to do that?

- This way, every 10 seconds, the currentIndex variable is incremented by 12, causing the ngFor loop to display a new set of 12 ratings from the array. When the end of the array is reached, the currentIndex is reset to 0 using the modulo operator, causing the loop to start over from the beginning of the array.
